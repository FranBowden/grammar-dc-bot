# Annoying Grammar Checker Bot

A Discord bot that checks chat messages for spelling & grammar mistakes (using [Harper](https://github.com/FranBowden/harper)) and replies with corrections, plus an angry GIF using Giphy.

Built with Node.js, discord.js, and Harper. This bot is designed to run in Discord servers

## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` file:
   ```
   BOT_TOKEN=...
   CLIENT_ID=...
   GIPHY_API_KEY=...
   ```
3. In the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), under your app's **Bot** settings, enable the **Message Content Intent** as the bot can't read message text to grammar-check it without this.
4. Invite the bot to your server with the **Administrator** permission (or, at minimum: View Channels, Send Messages, Read Message History, Embed Links, and Use Slash Commands).
6. Start the bot: `node src/index.js`

## Commands

- `/ping` — health check, replies with "Pong!"
- `/language` — set grammar dialect (American/British English) for the server
- `/gif-feature-toggle` — enable or disable the angry GIF reply for the server
- `/grammar-check-toggle` — enable or disable grammar checking entirely for the server
- `/strictness` — set how strict grammar checking is for the server:
  - `relaxed`
  - `standard` (default)
  - `strict`

Each command lives in its own file under [src/commands/](src/commands/)
